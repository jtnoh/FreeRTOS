/*
 * main() creates all the demo application tasks and a software timer, then 
 * starts the scheduler.  The web documentation provides more details of the 
 * standard demo application tasks, which provide no particular functionality, 
 * but do provide a good example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill both the core and floating point registers with
 * known values, then check that each register maintains its expected value for
 * the lifetime of the task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg
 * test tasks execute with a very low priority, so get preempted very
 * frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism.
 *
 * "Check" timer - The check software timer period is initially set to three
 * seconds.  The callback function associated with the check software timer
 * checks that all the standard demo tasks, and the register check tasks, are
 * not only still executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.  If
 * the check software timer discovers that a task has either stalled, or
 * reported an error, then it changes its own execution period from the initial
 * three seconds, to just 200ms.  The check software timer callback function
 * also toggles the single LED each time it is called.  This provides a visual
 * indication of the system status:  If the LED toggles every three seconds,
 * then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED toggles every 200ms, then
 * an issue has been discovered with at least one task.
 *
 * 
 * Additional code:
 * 
 * This demo does not contain a non-kernel interrupt service routine that
 * can be used as an example for application writers to use as a reference.
 * Therefore, the framework of a dummy (not installed) handler is provided
 * in this file.  The dummy function is called Dummy_IRQHandler().  Please
 * ensure to read the comments in the function itself, but more importantly,
 * the notes on the function contained on the documentation page for this demo
 * that is found on the FreeRTOS.org web site.
